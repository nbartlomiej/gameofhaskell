=Game Of Haskell

==About

Conway's Game of Life (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) implementation in Haskell, done as an excercise in Haskell BDD. Uses Hspec (https://github.com/trystan/hspec) for tests.

==Usage

    Running tests:
      $ runhaskell GameOfHaskellSpecs.hs
     
    Running main program:
      $ runhaskell GameOFHaskell.hs
    
==Development

The project utilizes guard (https://github.com/guard/guard), a tool that handles filesystem events. Here it is used to automatically run tests. Suggested workflow is as follows:

    1. Enter project directory
      $ clone http://github.com/nbartlomiej/gameofhaskell; cd gameofhaskell
     
    2. Install guard, guard-shell
      $ bundle install
     
    3. Run guard (will run tests on file change)
      $ guard
     
    4. Write specs in *Specs.hs files, implement them in *.hs files

==Origins

This project is loosely inspired by Global Day of Coderetreat 2011 (http://coderetreat.org/). The code itself hasn't been written during that event (obviously; participants delete all their creations), but contains many afterthoughts. Many thanks to @powczarek (http://twitter.com/powczarek) for great Haskell pair programming session.
